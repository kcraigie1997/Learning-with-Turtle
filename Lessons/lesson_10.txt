Welcome back!

Today we will be covering function.
This is quite an advanced subject, so i will try to keep it simple.

A function is container of code that can be run at any time.
You can see an example of this in the pre-generated code.

Using the def command you can create a function:

def square(length):
    for i in range(4):
        t.forward(length)
        t.right(90)

Lets break down the example.

def, use this so the system knows your making a function.
square, square is the name of the function.
(length), this is a name of a parameter that has been passed to the function.

to call the function above use the following command:

square(50)

If you are using a different name for the function you call it by:

<name of function>(<parameter>, <parameter>, <parameter>)

A parameter is a value or string that can be given to the function, this is useful when a function uses user input.
The parameter must be defined in the function.
In python there is system parameters but we wont be needing them, so we will ignore them.
A function can have as many parameters as you want.

There is plenty of stuff to play about with when using functions, so dont be shy!
