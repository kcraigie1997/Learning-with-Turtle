Welcome back!
Now we are going to look at making me move. To make me move we have to use the commands:
t.forward(10) – This will move me forward 10 spaces
t.back(10) – This will move me backward 10 spaces
t.left(10) – This will turn me left 10 spaces
t.right(10) – This will turn me right 10 spaces
Remember to put the ‘t.’ before the command. Otherwise I will not know you are telling me to move!
There number 10 can be changed with any number. This will make me move further!
Now to make the commands work, first we have to click at the end of the t = turtle.RawTurtle(res).
Then press enter to take a new line and press space 4 times. We need to do this because it is in a class.
After that you can enter t.forward(50). 
Click Save and then GO! And I should appear and move forward.
Once you see that feel free to try the other commands. Try getting me to draw a shape!
