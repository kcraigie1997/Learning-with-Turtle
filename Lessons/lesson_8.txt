Welcome back!

This will be about the other kind of loop, the while loop.

To use a while loop in python you do:

number = 0

while number < 21:
     t.back(number * 10)
     t.left(144)
     number = number + 1

This does the same as the example in as the for loop but this time uses a while loop.
As you can see a while loop works by setting the output to true until a condition is met, 
in this case number is less than 21.

You may also notice t.done(), this just stops the turtle from drawing.
If you leave this out when using while loops, I may start drawing random lines!

In python you can also use the else clause from if statements with while loops.
You use them the same way, so feel free to try them.
