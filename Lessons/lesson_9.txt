Welcome back!
We have seen both if statements and for loops and today we will use them together.
This may sound hard but it’s actually quite easy!
An example of how to do this is:

for i in range(20):
    if i % 2 == 0:
        t.pencolor('red')
    else:
        t.pencolor('green')
       
    t.forward(i * 10)
    t.right(144)

This is the star example from before however, this time you can see it changes colour based on an if.
The condition in the if checks if the number is odd or even, then changes the colour.

You can also do the same with while loops:

number = 0

while number < 21:
    if number % 2 == 0:
        t.pencolor('red')
    else:
        t.pencolor('green')

    t.back(number * 10)
    t.left(144)
    number = number + 1

As you can see this is very similar to using a for loop, meaning if you can do one you can do the other!

You can experiment with different if conditions, different results if condition is met and different ranges.
