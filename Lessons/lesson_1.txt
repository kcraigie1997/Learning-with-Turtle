Hey there! 
Welcome to Learning with turtle, today we are going over the code you see in the middle box.
If you look you can see:
def run(res): - This is the class that the code is in, we will find out about classes later so for now just think of it as a container for the code.
import turtle – This is makes you able to draw me.
t = turtle.RawTurtle(res) – This line makes me appear on the screen.
Now we should be able to click the save button followed by the run button and I should appear on screen!
