Welcome back!
Today we are going to learn about for loops.
A for loops is when code is ran for a certain number of times.
To use a for loop you use the command: 

for i in range(20):
    t.forward(i * 10)
    t.right(144)

this example when ran draws a star, it does by drawing longer lines as i gets higher. 
i is the current position in the range, meaning in this example the code will run 20 times before finishing

If you change the number in range(20) the loop will run longer, creating bigger shapes!

For loops are like if statements where you have to indent the code below.

You can experiment by putting different ranges, movement options and colours. 
This will change the result in a fun way!
