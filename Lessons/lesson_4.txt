Welcome back!
Since you can make me draw a shape, how about we have some fun!
With these commands we can colour the shape and lines:
t.fillcolor(“red”) – Sets the colour of the inside of the shape. You can put any colour in the brackets. Make sure this is before you draw.
t.begin_fill() – Starts filling the shape. Make sure this is before you draw.
t.end_fill() – Ends filling the shape. Make sure this is after the shape is drawn.

If you run the code the shape will be red inside.

I can also draw other shapes!

if you type t.circle(30) then i will draw a circle with the radius of 30. 
You can can change the number to make bigger or smaller circle.

You can also type t.dot() , which will make a coloured circle appear where you put the command.
You can put a size and a colour in the brackets like so t.dot(10, "red"). This can be used to make bigger dots.

Play around with these commands and get used to using them!
